    <h2>Regular expressions</h2>
    <p>in almost all cases the material to be parsed will be variable (e.g. values of real numbers)
    and this is captured through <i>regular expressions</i> or <i>regexes</i>. No matter what programming language 
    is used (Perl, Python, Java, etc.) there is no escape from these, but we have tried to make them
    as simple and error-free as possible. As an example let's assume that all keywords can be
    truncated to 4 characters (this is quite a common length) so that all the following are valid<br/>
    <code>
    DIHE, DIHED, DIHEDR, DIHEDRA, DIHEDRAL</code> and possibly <code>DIHEDRALS</code>
    <br/>
    It would be possible , but very inefficient, to write a template for each case. Regexes allow
    us to express this by<br/>
        <code>DIHE.*</code><br/>
    . This means:
    <br/>
    <i>Look for exactly 4 characters in order </i>(<code>D I H E</code>) <i>and then allow any character</i> (<b><tt>.</tt></b>) <i>any number
    of times including 0 </i>(<tt>*</tt>).<br/>
     The symbols (<b><tt>.</tt></b>) and (<tt>*</tt>) are known as "metacharacters".
     </p>
     <p>Regexes are now fairly standardised and the Java syntax is common (see the 
     <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/">Java tutorial</a>). It's worth
     following these tutorials to get a basic understanding. You'll also benefit from online tutorials such 
     as listed on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476714/is-there-a-good-online-interactive-regex-tutorial">StackOverflow</a>
     as <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">Regular-expressions.info</a>. However 
     you can go a long way with JUMBOParser with only a small amount. Here's 99% of what I use in writing parsers. Note
     that the backslash is necessary and fairly common.
     <table border="1">
     <tr><th>Metacharacter</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>.</tt></b></td><td>any character</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>\s</tt></b></td><td>a single space</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>\S</tt></b></td><td>a non-space character</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>\d</tt></b></td><td>any single digit</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>[JUMBO]</tt></b></td><td>any of the characters J, U, M, B, O</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>[A-Z]</tt></b></td><td>any of the characters A,B,C...Z</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>[A-Za-z]</tt></b></td><td>any of the characters A,B,C...Z and a,b,c,...z</td></tr>
     <tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>?</tt></b></td><td>optional: count of 0 or 1</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>*</tt></b></td><td>count of 0 or more</td></tr>
     <tr><td><b><tt>+</tt></b></td><td>count of 1 or more</td></tr>
     </table>
     <p>The downside of this is that when metacharacters (<code>. [ ] { } ( ) - + * \</code> - not a complete list) occur normally they have to be escaped with a backslash. 
     So you will frequently see <code>\. \[ \] \{ \} \( \) \- \+ \* \\</code> . This can be tedious and
     is also error-prone so we have created a number of macros that make it easier for you.</p>
     <p>Here are some examples:
<pre>
 Charge =  0 Multiplicity = 1
</pre>    
is matched by
<pre>
 Charge =  \d Multiplicity = \d
</pre>
In this the whitespace is fragile, so I tend to write:
<pre>
\s*Charge\s*=\s*\d\s*Multiplicity\s*=\s*\d\s*
</pre>
which means that if space is stripped by any tool in the chain, it's still parsed. However it's not pretty.
Therefore we have a series of macros (symbols for common regexes) which manage the spaces and avoid many of the
backslashes.
<pre>
\s*Charge ={I}Multiplicity ={I}
</pre>
where the JUMBO-specific syntax {I} denotes an integer. The power comes when we include floats and capture.
Another example with an ASCII-formatted table:
<pre>
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ! R1    R(1,2)                  1.394          calculate D2E/DX2 analytically  !
 ! R41   R(22,23)                1.066          calculate D2E/DX2 analytically  !
 ! A1    A(2,1,3)              110.8657         calculate D2E/DX2 analytically  !
</pre>
is matched by:
<pre>
\s\-+\s*
</pre>
This is read as: <i>1 space; followed by 1-or-more minus signs (escaped as it's a metacharacter);followed by 0-or-more spaces</i>.
 (We cannot be sure that there aren't trailing spaces so we almost always end regexes with <tt>\s*</tt>).
 
<pre>
\s!\s[RAD]\d+\s+\S+\s+[\d\.]+\s+.*!\s*
</pre>

 This is read as: <i>1 space; one shriek; 1 space; an A, R or D followed by one or more digits;
 1-or-more spaces; 1-or-more non-spaces; 1-or-more spaces; a mixture of digits and periods; 1-or-more
 spaces; anything; 1 shriek; optional trailing whitespace.</i>
 </p>
 <p>You may have thought that there are better ways to do this - there are almost always many 
 different regexes which can parse the files and the best strategy will depend on the variability
 in the corpus. In the current example we almost certainly want to capture the values and the next section shows us how.
 </p>
 <p>
The macros will protect you from raw regexes from JUMBO, but here are the basics of how fields are captured. In the above example
we can capture the name and the value by:
<pre>
\s!\s([RAD]\d+)\s+\S+\s+([\d\.]+)\s+.*!\s*
</pre>
This gives two captureGroups (1 and 2 - the whole string is captureGroup 0). Normally you need access to the Java code
to pick them up but JUMBO does this for you. It can also, optionally, give symbolic names (and even units).
So in JUMBO specifically we can write:
<pre>
\s!\s(A,am:name)\s+\S+\s+(F,am:distance)\s+.*!\s*
</pre>
This captures the names (R12, D3, A32, etc.) into the symbolic variable <tt>am:name</tt> and the
distances into <tt>am:distance</tt>. There are a a small number of these macros, and we'll add more gradually:
<table border="1">
<tr><th>macro</th><th>captures</th><th>examples</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt><b>I</b></tt></td><td>any integer</td><td><tt>123 -34 0</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><b>F</b></tt></td><td>real number</td><td><tt>1.23 2. 3 -13.4 -4</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><b>E</b></tt></td><td>scientific notation</td><td><tt>1.23E+02 1.23D-04 2.1 -1.34 </tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><b>A</b></tt></td><td>string without spaces</td><td><tt>A23 -12Z df=3.2</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><b>X</b></tt></td><td>any string</td><td><tt>"A23 -12Z df=3.2"</tt></td></tr>
</table>
Note that the macros have optional leading and trailing spaces so you can usually omit them.
We may also introduce dates and booleans. Just for interest here is the regex for floats:
<pre>
\s*((?:\-?\d+\.?\d*)|(?:\-?\d*\.?\d+))\s*
</pre>
(The exponential is worse!). That's more advanced than you need to know and the macros protect you from it!
</p> 
<p>Sometimes fields are repeated horizontally and here JUMBO allows for repeated fields:
<pre>
 Rotational constants (GHZ):      1.2383395      0.8928269      0.6713269
</pre>
is matched by:
<pre>
\s*Rotational constants \(GHZ\):{3F,g:rotconst}
</pre>
which extracts exactly 3 floats into an array. Sometimes the number varies, as in:
<pre>
     Eigenvalues ---    0.35005   0.35915   0.36224   0.36629   0.37167
     Eigenvalues ---    0.51910   1.01166   1.02582
</pre>
and we write
<pre>
\s*Eigenvalues \-\-\- {1_5F,g:eigenval}
</pre>
where <tt>1_5</tt> means 1 to5.
Sometimes we need precise columns, as in:
<pre>
     Eigenvalues ---    0.37456   0.37560   0.38218   0.38586   0.39602
     Eigenvalues ---    0.40148   0.40211   0.40329   0.46257   0.48142
     Eigenvalues ---    0.51910   1.01166   1.025821000.000001000.00000
</pre>
where the floats have run into each other. Counting the columns shows F10.5 
with one space after the dashes. The following will capture this:
<pre>
\s*Eigenvalues \-\-\-\s{1_5F10.5,g:eigenval}
</pre>
