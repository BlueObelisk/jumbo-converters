  <div class="section">
    <h2>Patterns</h2>
    <p>Some logfiles are easy to chunk and have phrases such as:
<pre>
Begin OPTIM
... stuff ...
End OPTIM
</pre>    
and the parsing strategy is relatively simple
<pre>
  &lt;template id="optim"
    pattern="Begin OPTIM\s*"
    endPattern="End OPTIM\s*">
    ... stuff ...
  &lt;/template>
</pre>    
In this case the "End OPTIM" is redundant in that we don't need its content. However in many cases 
we need clever patterns to define the start and end of chunks. Here's an example (GAMESS_UK):
<pre>
block = coordinates records =     4 unit = au
  c             0.0000000      0.0000000      0.9998719
  o             0.0000000      0.0000000     -1.2734685
  h             0.0000000      1.7650647      2.0942583
  h             0.0000000     -1.7650647      2.0942583
block = connectivity records =    3
    1    2
    1    3
    1    4
block = mulliken_ao_populations records =   22
  1.986719
  0.426035
</pre>    
Here we see that the start of one <tt>block</tt> is the end of the preceding one. So we might write:
<pre>
  &lt;template id="coords"
    pattern="block = coordinates.*"
    endPattern="block = connectivity.*">
    ... stuff ...
  &lt;/template>
  &lt;template id="connectivity"
    pattern="block = connectivity.*"
    pattern="block = mulliken_ao_populations.*">
    ... stuff ...
  &lt;/template>
</pre>    
But we don't want the <tt>coords</tt> block to eat the string <tt>block = connectivity ...</tt>. 
JUMBO therefore has two pointers, <tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt>. By default they are left
at the positions where the start of their patterns match. Thus after <tt>coords</tt> matches
we have:
<pre>
start>>>>
block = coordinates records =     4 unit = au
  c             0.0000000      0.0000000      0.9998719
  o             0.0000000      0.0000000     -1.2734685
  h             0.0000000      1.7650647      2.0942583
  h             0.0000000     -1.7650647      2.0942583
end>>>>
block = connectivity records =    3
    1    2
    1    3
    1    4
block = mulliken_ao_populations records =   22
  1.986719
  0.426035
</pre>
and after <tt>connectivity</tt> we have
<pre>
block = coordinates records =     4 unit = au
  c             0.0000000      0.0000000      0.9998719
  o             0.0000000      0.0000000     -1.2734685
  h             0.0000000      1.7650647      2.0942583
  h             0.0000000     -1.7650647      2.0942583
start>>>>
block = connectivity records =    3
    1    2
    1    3
    1    4
end>>>>
block = mulliken_ao_populations records =   22
  1.986719
  0.426035
</pre>
Each block will start tidily with the first line and end before the next block. But sometimes 
the endPattern matches something we need, as in:
<pre>
 Mulliken charges with hydrogens summed into heavy atoms:
              1
     1  O   -0.712526
     2  C    0.915269
    22  C   -0.077693
 Sum of Mulliken charges with hydrogens summed into heavy atoms =   0.00000
</pre>
where we don't know what comes next and need to use the <tt>Sum of...</tt> both as the end
marker and also to provide the value. We can move the <tt>end</tt> pointer forward:
<pre>
  <template id="mulliken"
    pattern="\s*Mulliken charges with hydrogens summed into heavy atoms.*"
    endPattern="\s*Sum of Mulliken charges with hydrogens summed into heavy atoms.*"
    endOffset="1">
    </template>
</pre>
This leaves the pointers as:
<pre>
start>>>>
 Mulliken charges with hydrogens summed into heavy atoms:
              1
     1  O   -0.712526
     2  C    0.915269
    22  C   -0.077693
 Sum of Mulliken charges with hydrogens summed into heavy atoms =   0.00000
 end>>>>
</pre>
This allows all the material between the pointers to be processed into the template. 
<tt>endOffset</tt> is quite frequently used; there is a corresponding <tt>offset</tt>
for the start which is occasionally necessary.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to match more than one contiguous line and this will be covered later.
Although there are chunks that cannot be extracted with JUMBO we have found very few in practice.
We shall probably add additional patterns (e.g. to find the last occurrence of a string).</p>
