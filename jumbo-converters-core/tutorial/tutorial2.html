  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Analysing the files to be parsed</h2>
    <p>We assume that we <b>don't</b> know the precise form of the program that output the information, although
    it's useful to guess it's FORTRAN and assume that most output is column-formattted. This means that fields 
    can run together. For example MDL Molfiles have (3I3) for the bond numbers and orders giving an output like:
    <pre>
  1  2  1
  2  3  1
</pre>
However with 100 or more atoms the fields run together, e.g. atom 102 bonded to 121 would be:
    <pre>
101121  1
</pre>
so that relying on whitespace would fail. However in most cases whitespace-parsing can be used and is easier than
 counting the column numbers - but you will will probably need both
 </p>
 <p>It's worth looking at a small number of files to see how much they vary. JUMBOParsers don't have to be complete
 or completely correct at first and we can add new details when we get more documents. In general we start simple and 
 add more details as we get a better understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
 We'll use the same file as before:

</pre>
Here's how I think about a simple parser.
<ul>
  <li>The file is neatly chunked into blocks which start with a unique keyword and are terminated by a 
  blank. Note: We <b>always</b> bear in mind that it could be more complex than we think and I'll put these caveats
 like (<i>"watch out for abbreviations"</i>). There are six keywords (<i>"but there might be more"</i>) and 
 they are all uppercase - FORTRAN is often uppercase - (<i>"but they may not always be"</i>). 
 It's possible they may be abbreviated (<i>"DIHE looks like an abbreviation"</i>) and we'll allow for that. 
 The bonds, angles and dihedrals (I sometimes call these "torsions" and so does CML) are all very similar
 dealing with 2,3,and 4 atomTypes respectively, so we'll start with BOND and if that works expand to the others.
 We know nothing of MASS, IMPROPER and NBOND and so can't write any parser at this stage.
 </li>
 <li>All blocks end with a blank line. This is very useful - it would be slightly harder if they didn't.
 </li>
 <li>There is a wide variation of the floating-point numbers (number of decimals) and we should assume that
 they will not be very regular.</li>
 <li>The trailing information in the fields seems to be irregular (note the optional commas and &gt; in BOND) and
 it may have been typed by hand (and should be avoided);
</ul>

    <h2>A minimal parser</h2>
    <p>Parsers are based on <b>template</b>s which attempt to identify "chunk"s of information and extract the free text
    into them. Not surprisingly the whole parser is a single template, and templates can be nested and referenced
    so the approach is very flexible. The simplest parser (amber.minimal.template.xml)is therefore:
    <pre>
    &lt;template id="amber">
    &lt;/template>
    
    </pre>
Run: <code>amber.minimal.template.xml</code> on <code>amber.inp</code> => <code>amber.minimal.out.xml</code></p>
<p>The output (cut down) is:
<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;module 
  cmlx:templateRef="amber.minimal.example" 
  xmlns="http://www.xml-cml.org/schema" 
  xmlns:cmlx="http://www.xml-cml.org/schema/cmlx"
  >MASSBONDcq-ca 428.1   1.397 k (3_2: 5 points @0.01A == 0-1 Kcal), dist from mp2/6-31G*c2-cq 330.1
  ...
     IMPROPERNONBON&lt;/module>
</pre>
  Note:
  <ul>
    <li>Whitespace has been elided. Whitespace is very fragile and you should NEVER rely on it. 
    JUMBOParser has robust methods for it.</li>
    <li>The parser has added the namespaces (CML (http://www.xml-cml.org/schema) and CMLX (http://www.xml-cml.org/schema/cmlx)). 
    Many parsed files contain a long list of namespaces and attributes on the root element.</li>
    <li>All elements belong to the CML namespace; attributes which are NOT part of CML are
    usually represented by CMLX attributes (e.g. <tt>templateRef</tt>).</li>
    <li>The <tt>template</tt> elements normally map onto <tt>cml:module</tt> elements and their <tt>id</tt>s map onto
    <tt>templateRef</tt> attributes. The result will always have a root element of type <tt>cml:module</tt></li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
    <h2>Chunking a file into modules</h2>
    <p>We now look at how to split the file into the natural chunks. Our current example is straightforward; it's easy to see where the
    blocks are and also easy to write a template. To create a template we need:
    <ul>
      <li>a startPattern (<tt><b>pattern</b></tt>). This is virtually mandatory.</li>
      <li>an endPattern (<tt><b>endPattern</b></tt>). This is frequent but can sometimes 
      be omitted. In the examples we shall always have one.</li>
      <li>an id (<tt><b>id</b></tt>). This should be unique within the template and its descendants
      and ideally unique within the root tenmplate. Careful naming of the identifier is very valuable in later steps.</li>
      <li>a repeat count (<tt><b>repeat</b></tt>). By default the template can only be triggered once (<tt>repeat="1"</tt>),
       and it's common for most templates to be trigged as often as wanted (<tt>repeat="*"</tt>) .</li>
    </ul>
    There are also other attributes (<tt>offset</tt>, <tt>endOffset</tt> and <tt>newline</tt>) which you will encounter later.
    </p>
    <p>For all except the simplest files we need to nest templates, if necessarily to 3 or even more levels. The
    general structure is:
    <pre>
      &lt;template id="top">
        &lt;templateList>
          &lt;template id="level1.1">...&lt;/template>
          &lt;template id="level1.2">...&lt;/template>
          &lt;template id="level1.3">
	        &lt;templateList>
	          &lt;template id="level1.3.1">...&lt;/template>
	          &lt;template id="level1.3.2">...&lt;/template>
	        &lt;/templateList>
          &lt;/template>
        &lt;/templateList>
      &lt;/template>
    </pre>
    and these will produce nested modules. Note that one <tt>template</tt> can, with an indefinite <tt>repeat</tt>
    count, produce many <tt>cml:module</tt>s.
    </p>
    <p>
    The next step is to create nested templates (<tt>amber.chunk.template.xml</tt>) that represent the chunk structure:
    <pre>
	&lt;template id="amber.example">
	  &lt;templateList>
	    &lt;template id="angle" pattern="ANGLE" endPattern="\s*">
	      &lt;comment class="example">
	cd-c2-cd 100.211 121.085 k (16_1_25: 5 points at 1 degree 0-&gt;0.8 Kcal) angle from mp2/6-31G*
	      &lt;/comment>
	    &lt;/template>
	    
	    &lt;template id="bond" pattern="BOND" endPattern="\s*">
	      &lt;comment class="example">
	cq-ca 428.1 1.397 k (3_2: 5 points @0.01A == 0-1 Kcal), dist from mp2/6-31G*
	      &lt;/comment>
	    &lt;/template>
	    
	    &lt;template id="dihed" pattern="DIHE.*" endPattern="\s*">
	      &lt;comment class="example">
	c3-nh-cc-cc 4 14.500 180.000 2.000 (X -ca-ca-X)
	      &lt;/comment>
	    &lt;/template>
	    
	    &lt;template id="improper" pattern="IMPR.*" endPattern="\s*"/>
	    &lt;template id="mass" pattern="MASS" endPattern="\s*"/>
	    &lt;template id="nonbond" pattern="NONB.*" endPattern="\s*"/>
	  &lt;/templateList>
	&lt;/template>
    </pre>
    The <tt>comment</tt> elements have an important purpose. Not only do they contain examples which
    help to remind the author but they also support unit tests as we shall see. We'll explain the Patterns 
    and their regular expressions later.
    </p>
    <p>Run this<br/>
<tt>amber.chunk.template.xml</tt> on <tt>amber.inp</tt> => <tt>amber.chunk.out.xml</tt>    
</p>
<p>Here's the result (<tt>amber.chunk.out.xml</tt>)

Note:
<ul>
  <li>The ORDER of the input information is preserved. This is universal within 
  JUMBOParser (which can never alter the order of characters and lines - the 
  <tt>transform</tt> element can do that.</li>
  <li>All the blocks , even those with minimal content, have been identified. No content (other than
  whitespace) has been lost or changed.</li>
  <li>The mapping between <tt>template</tt>s and <tt>cml:module</tt>s is exact in this case. The <tt>cmlx:templateRef</tt>
  is derived from the <tt>id</tt>. These attributes can be easily transformed or
  removed later.</li>
