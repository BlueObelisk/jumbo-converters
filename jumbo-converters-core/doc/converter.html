<h1>Creating and running JUMBOConverters</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h2>Bugs and tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Running one template directly after another may miss the first line and this means the chunk is missed.
 Shuffling the order of templates may cure this.</li>
 <li>Make sure that all regex metacharacters are escaped with a \. The known ones are
 <pre>
 \ $ ^ * ( ) - [ ] { } ? .
 </pre>
 </li>
 <li>the following metacharacters in  XML documents must be escaped:
 <pre> &amp; &lt; and possibly &apos; </pre>
  to
 <pre> &amp;amp; &amp;lt; &amp;apos; </pre>
 (They normally occur in examples)
 </li>
 <li>Watch out for (unnatural) floats/integer variation (e.g. 16.0 electrons)</li>
 <li>Some codes have variants that look very similar but differe by number of spaces, float/integer, commas, etc.
 </li>
 <li>Make sure that the template has eaten the full chunk you want to parse. Omitting any record children will show
 what you have caught.</li>
 <li>Some floats are very variable (e.g. .100E-06)</li>
 <li>If endPattern uses the last line, make sure endOffset is set (usually 1)</li>
 <li>Capitalization: NWChem uses both "Energy Calculation" and "cnergy calculation" as titles for the same basic routine (argh)
 <li>"Illegal repetition near index". Common reaqson is that JUMBO syntax {X} cannot be used in template pattern.
</ul>
