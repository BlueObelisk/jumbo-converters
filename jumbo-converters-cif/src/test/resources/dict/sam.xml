  <entry term="atom_site_label" id="atom_site_label">
    <description>Corresponds to the _atom_site_label term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> The _atom_site_label is a unique identifier for a particular site in the crystal. This code is made up of a sequence of up to seven components, _atom_site_label_component_0 to *_6, which may be specified as separate data items. Component 0 usually matches one of the specified _atom_type_symbol codes. This is not mandatory if an _atom_site_type_symbol item is included in the atom-site list. The _atom_site_type_symbol always takes precedence over an _atom_site_label in the identification of the atom type. The label components 1 to 6 are optional, and normally only components 0 and 1 are used. Note that components 0 and 1 are concatenated, while all other components, if specified, are separated by an underscore. Underscores are only used if higher-order components exist. If an intermediate component is not used, it may be omitted provided the underscore separators are inserted. For example, the label 'C233__ggg' is acceptable and represents the components C, 233, '' and ggg. Different labels may have a different number of components. </definition>

    <definition> The extinction coefficient used to calculate the correction factor applied to the structure-factor data. The nature of the extinction coefficient is given in the definitions of _refine_ls_extinction_expression and _refine_ls_extinction_method.

    <description>Corresponds to the _refine_ls_extinction_method term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> A description of the extinction-correction method applied. This description should include information about the correction method, either 'Becker-Coppens' or 'Zachariasen'. The latter is sometimes referred to as the 'Larson' method even though it employs Zachariasen's formula. The Becker-Coppens procedure is referred to as 'type 1' when correcting secondary extinction dominated by the mosaic spread; as 'type 2' when secondary extinction is dominated by particle size and includes a primary extinction component; and as 'mixed' when there is a mixture of types 1 and 2. For the Becker-Coppens method, it is also necessary to set the mosaic distribution as either 'Gaussian' or 'Lorentzian' and the nature of the extinction as 'isotropic' or 'anisotropic'. Note that if either the 'mixed' or 'anisotropic' corrections are applied, the multiple coefficients cannot be contained in *_extinction_coef and must be listed in _refine_special_details.

    <definition> The proportion of Friedel-related reflections present in the number of 'independent' reflections specified by the item _reflns_number_total.

Examples: (a) For centrosymmetric structures, _reflns_Friedel_coverage is necessarily equal to 0.0 as the crystal class is identical to the Laue symmetry. (b) For whole-sphere data for a crystal in the space group P1, _reflns_Friedel_coverage is equal to 1.0, as no reflection h k l is equivalent to -h -k -l in the crystal class and all Friedel pairs {h k l; -h -k -l} have been measured. (c) For whole-sphere data in space group Pmm2, _reflns_Friedel_coverage will be &lt; 1.0 because although reflections h k l and -h -k -l are not equivalent when h k l indices are nonzero, they are when l=0. (d) For a crystal in the space group Pmm2, measurements of the two inequivalent octants h &gt;= 0, k &gt;=0, l lead to the same value as in (c), whereas measurements of the two equivalent octants h &gt;= 0, k, l &gt;= 0 will lead to a value of zero for _reflns_Friedel_coverage. </definition>

  <entry term="space_group_IT_number" id="space_group_IT_number">
    <description>Corresponds to the _space_group_IT_number term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> The number as assigned in International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A, specifying the proper affine class (i.e. the orientation-preserving affine class) of space groups (crystallographic space-group type) to which the space group belongs. This number defines the space-group type but not the coordinate system in which it is expressed. </definition>

  <entry term="space_group_name_H-M_alt" id="space_group_name_H-M_alt">
    <description>Corresponds to the _space_group_name_H-M_alt term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> _space_group_name_H-M_alt allows any Hermann-Mauguin symbol to be given. The way in which this item is used is determined by the user and in general is not intended to be interpreted by computer. It may, for example, be used to give one of the extended Hermann-Mauguin symbols given in Table 4.3.2.1 of International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002) or a Hermann-Mauguin symbol for a conventional or unconventional setting. Each component of the space-group name is separated by a space or an underscore. The use of a space is strongly recommended. The underscore is only retained because it was used in older files. It should not be used in new CIFs. Subscripts should appear without special symbols. Bars should be given as negative signs before the numbers to which they apply. The commonly used Hermann-Mauguin symbol determines the space- group type uniquely but a given space-group type may be described by more than one Hermann-Mauguin symbol. The space- group type is best described using _space_group_IT_number. The Hermann-Mauguin symbol may contain information on the choice of basis, but not on the choice of origin. To define the setting uniquely, use _space_group_name_Hall or list the symmetry operations. </definition>

  <entry term="space_group_name_Hall" id="space_group_name_Hall">
    <description>Corresponds to the _space_group_name_Hall term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> Space-group symbol defined by Hall. Each component of the space-group name is separated by a space or an underscore. The use of a space is strongly recommended. The underscore is only retained because it was used in older files. It should not be used in new CIFs. _space_group_name_Hall uniquely defines the space group and its reference to a particular coordinate system. Ref: Hall, S. R. (1981). Acta Cryst. A37, 517-525; erratum (1981), A37, 921. [See also International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. B (2001), Chapter 1.4, Appendix 1.4.2] </definition>

  <entry term="space_group_symop_id" id="space_group_symop_id">
    <description>Corresponds to the _space_group_symop_id term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> An arbitrary identifier that uniquely labels each symmetry operation in the list. In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity operation should have _space_group_symop_id or _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id set to 1, and _space_group_symop_operation_xyz or _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz set to x,y,z; i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity operation. </definition>

  <entry term="space_group_symop_operation_xyz" id="space_group_symop_operation_xyz">
    <description>Corresponds to the _space_group_symop_operation_xyz term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> A parsable string giving one of the symmetry operations of the space group in algebraic form. If W is a matrix representation of the rotational part of the symmetry operation defined by the positions and signs of x, y and z, and w is a column of translations defined by fractions, an equivalent position X' is generated from a given position X by the equation X' = WX + w (Note: X is used to represent bold_italics_x in International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A, Part 5) When a list of symmetry operations is given, it must contain a complete set of coordinate representatives which generates all the operations of the space group by the addition of all primitive translations of the space group. Such representatives are to be found as the coordinates of the general-equivalent position in International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002), to which it is necessary to add any centring translations shown above the general-equivalent position. That is to say, it is necessary to list explicitly all the symmetry operations required to generate all the atoms in the unit cell defined by the setting used. In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity operation should have _space_group_symop_id or _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id set to 1, and _space_group_symop_operation_xyz or _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz set to x,y,z; i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity operation. </definition>

    <description>Corresponds to the _symmetry_space_group_name_H-M term in the IUCr Core CIF dictionary.</description>
    <definition> Hermann-Mauguin space-group symbol. Note that the Hermann-Mauguin symbol does not necessarily contain complete information about the symmetry and the space-group origin. If used, always supply the FULL symbol from International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002) and indicate the origin and the setting if it is not implicit. If there is any doubt that the equivalent positions can be uniquely deduced from this symbol, specify the _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz or *_Hall data items as well. Leave spaces between symbols referring to different axes. </definition>

The format of the data item is as per International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A. (2002). All equivalent positions should be entered, including those for lattice centring and a centre of symmetry, if present. In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity operation should have _space_group_symop_id or _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id set to 1, and _space_group_symop_operation_xyz or _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz set to x,y,z; i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity operation. </definition>
