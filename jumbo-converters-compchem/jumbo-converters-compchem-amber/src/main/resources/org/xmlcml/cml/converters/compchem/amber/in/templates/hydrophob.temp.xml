Force field parameter modification file specification
      Modified  force  field  parameters in file frcmod: This file is
      normally the one that will be changed by the user.  It consists
      of  a 1-card title, followed by a blank line, then keyword sec-
      tions.  The allowed keywords (appearing in columns 1-4) are:


      MASS          follow this card by card of type - 2 - listed in the
                    unit 10 instructions above.  End with a blank line.

      BOND          follow this card by card of type - 4 - listed in the
                    unit 10 instructions above.  End with a blank line.

      ANGL          follow this card by card of type - 5 - listed in the
                    unit 10 instructions above.  End with a blank line.

      DIHE          follow this card by card of type - 6 - listed in the
                    unit 10 instructions above.  End with a blank line.

      IMPR          follow this card by card of type - 7 - listed in the
                    unit 10 instructions above.  End with a blank line.

      HBON          follow this card by card of type - 8 - listed in the
                    unit 10 instructions above.  End with a blank line.

      NONB          follow this card by card of type - 10A, B or C - listed
                    in the unit 10 instructions above.  E.g. if you specify
                    STDA in parm.in for the "regular" parm.dat file, this is
                    the convention that will be used when reading frcmod.
                    End with a blank line.


           Any or all of the keywords may be missing, if you have  no
      changes  for  that  section.  The entire file can be missing if
      you have no changes at all to make to the standard force field.
      Restrictions:  note that you cannot modify the equivalence pat-
      tern set up in the standard force field.

           If you have parameters in the frcmod file that modify val-
      ues  in the standard parameter file, and if iparml is set to 2,
      then both the original and  the  modified  parameters  will  be
      printed  to  the  output file.  The modified parameters will be
      marked with asterisks, and it is these values that will be used
      in subsequent calculations.
