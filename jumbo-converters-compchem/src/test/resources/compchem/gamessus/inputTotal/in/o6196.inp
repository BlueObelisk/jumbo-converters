! EXAM 41.
!   This job illustrates TDDFT/PBE0/6-31+G(d) for
!   the 3 lowest singlet excited states of CO.
!   There are diffuse functions in the basis set,
!   as excited states often have Rydberg character.
!
!   The geometry is the experimental ground state's.
!   The first excited state need not have the same
!   geometry as the G.S., so its gradient is big.
!   experimental Te is 8.06 to 1-pi,
!                      8.17 to 1-sigma-minus
!   Of course this run computes vertical T0 values.
!   Computational results on the log file show that
!   these two valence states arise from sigma->pi*
!   and pi->pi* excitations, respectively.

!            Results for the gas phase:
