This tests the finite nucleus integrals, which have been checked against
results from DREAMS. There are four SCF tasks. The basis set is the cc-pVDZ
set recontracted for a finite nucleus. The first task explicitly sets all
nuclei to be finite. The second simply uses the default point nucleus
model. The third sets finite by default. The fourth sets finite by default
and overrides the default for the H atoms with a point nucleus. The first
and third energies should be the same; the fourth is very close to the
first and third; the second differs in the fourth decimal.
