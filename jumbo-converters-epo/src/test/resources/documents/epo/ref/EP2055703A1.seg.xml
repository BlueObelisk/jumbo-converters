  <description id="desc" lang="en">
    <field id="h0001" title="Technical Field">
      <p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel pyrimidine compound having a benzyl(pyridylmethyl)amine structure and inhibitory activity against cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), and a medicament comprising the same.</p>
    </field> 
    <priorArt id="h0002" title="Background Art">
      <p id="p0002" num="0002">In recent years, hyperlipidemia and arteriosclerotic diseases resulting therefrom have been rapidly increasing due to changes into high calorie and high cholesterol-type diet with improvements in living standard, obesity, lack of exercise, aging, and the like. Because a level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a triglyceride level positively correlate with a risk of onset of heart diseases, conventional pharmacotherapies for hyperlipidemia and arteriosclerosis have been focused on reduction of blood lipids. Whilst, it has been revealed by many researches so far that a level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in plasma negatively correlates with the onset of ischemic heart diseases, and hypo-HDL-emia is considered as one of risk factors of arteriosclerosis. However, no medicament is available at present which selectively and markedly raises an HDL level, and development of such a medicament has been desired.</p>
      <p id="p0003" num="0003">Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is an extremely hydrophobic protein which transfers a cholesterol ester from HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol or the like, and HDL cholesterol can be increased by inhibiting the transfer by CETP.</p>
      <p id="p0004" num="0004">Niacin significantly increases HDL cholesterol, but has a serious problem of resistance which reduces compliance. Although fibrates and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors slightly increase an HDL cholesterol level (10 to 12%), they fail to satisfy
        <!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> medical needs of achieving significant increase of a plasma HDL cholesterol level to delay progress of atherosclerosis. Whilst, the CETP inhibitor attains a potent increase of an HDL cholesterol level, thereby a treatment of hyperlipidemia is achievable with high effectiveness that cannot be exceeded by neither of fibrate or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and thus prophylactic or therapeutic agents for arteriosclerosis or hyperlipidemia, which are conventionally unavailable, are expectedly provided. The CETP inhibitors attain the increase in HDL cholesterol and the decrease in LDL cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol level by a mechanism different from that of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and accordingly, a combinational effect of a CETP inhibitor and a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor can also be expected.
      </p>
      <p id="p0005" num="0005">Several reports have been made so far about compounds to inhibit CETP activity For example, a thiol derivative which forms a disulfide bond by a reaction with a cysteine residue of CETP to inhibit the CETP activity has been reported (Patent document 1, Non-patent document 1). However, the thiol derivative requires a large amount of administration for expression of the action, and side reactions by formation of disulfide bond with other proteins are concerned.</p>
      <p id="p0006" num="0006">As CETP inhibitors having a mode of action different from that of the thiol derivative, tetrahydroquinoline derivatives have been disclosed (Patent documents 2 to 4). However, these derivatives are highly liposoluble compounds, and due to low oral absorption resulting from the low water-solubility, they require a pharmaceutical means for obtaining a blood level sufficient for expression of the efficacy (Patent document 5).</p>
      <p id="p0007" num="0007">Further, tetrahydronaphthylidine derivatives are disclosed as compounds having potent CETP inhibitory activities (Patent document 6). Benzylamine derivatives and the like are also disclosed as compounds having potent CETP inhibitory activity. However, they are highly liposoluble compounds in the same manner as the aforementioned tetrahydroquinoline derivatives (Patent documents 7 and 8).</p>
      <p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, compounds having a benzyl(heterocyclylmethyl)amine structure
        <!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> are disclosed (Patent document 9). However, the pyrimidine compounds of the present invention having a benzyl(pyridylmethyl)amine structure are not described or suggested, and the compounds described in Patent document 9 are found to have insufficient CETP inhibitory activity as specifically shown in test examples described later.

As the metal catalyst, for example, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)(chloroform)dipalladium(0), [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and the like may be independently used, but a ligand such as 2-biphenyl(di-t-butylphosphine) and 2-biphenyl(dicyclohexylphosphine) may also be used in combination. As the solvent, although not particularly limited, for example, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, dioxane , N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, water and the like may be used alone or in combination. Further, the amine (IV) may be used as the solvent. Although the base is not particularly limited, for example, alkali metal hydrides such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride and potassium hydride, alkali metals such as lithium, sodium and potassium, alkali metal hydroxides such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and cesium carbonate, lithium diisopropylamide, sodium diisopropylamide, potassium diisopropylamide, lithium hexamethyldisilazide, sodium hexamethyldisilazide, potassium hexamethyldisilazide, sodium t-butoxide, potassium t-butoxide, n-butyllithium, s-butyllithium, t-butyllithium and the like may be used. As for the reaction conditions, although they should be changed depending on the starting material to be used, the target compound can be obtained by starting the reaction generally at 0 to 180Â°C, preferably at room temperature under microwave irradiation, elevating the temperature to 80 to 150Â°C, and performing the reaction for 1

The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, further added with boron tribromide (1.0 mol/L solution in dichloromethane, 450 ÂµL, 0.45 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 50Â°C for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was added with water, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layers were combined, washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by preparative silica gel thin layer chromatography (chloroform:methanol =20:1) to obtain the title compound (3.1 mg, 18 %) as green oil.</p>

The CETP activity in this plasma was measured with Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Activity kit (Roar Biomedical, catalog No.: RB-CETP). Specifically, to each well of a 96-well plate, 95 ÂµL of a buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 2 ÂµL of Donor particle and 2 ÂµL of Acceptor particle were added, 1 ÂµL of the human plasma after the incubation was added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated in an incubator at 37Â°C for 2 hours. After completion of the incubation, fluorescence intensity (FLU) was measured with a fluorescence plate reader (excitation
