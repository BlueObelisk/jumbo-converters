    <priorArt id="h0002" title="Background to the Invention and Prior Art">
      <p id="p0002" num="0002">In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the drug substance to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. This is of importance, not only from the point of view of obtaining a commercially-viable manufacturing process, but also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compound.</p>
      <p id="p0003" num="0003">Further, in the manufacture of drug compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of drug is provided following administration to a patient.</p>
      <p id="p0004" num="0004">Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active ingredients are also very important factors. The drug substance, and compositions containing it, should preferably be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the active component's physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility).</p>
      <p id="p0005" num="0005">Moreover, it is also important to be able to provide drug in a form which is as chemically pure as possible.</p>
      <p id="p0006" num="0006">The skilled person will appreciate that, typically, if a drug can be readily obtained in a stable form, such as a stable crystalline form, advantages may be provided, in terms of ease of handling, ease of preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations, and a more reliable solubility profile.

        <p id="p0155" num="0155">The following generic method was employed to prepare salts of Compound A: 200 mg of Compound A (see Preparation A above) was dissolved in 5 mL of MeOH. To this solution was added a solution of the relevant acid (1.0 molar equivalent) dissolved in 5 mL of MeOH. After stirring for 10 minutes at room temperature, the solvent was removed by way of a rotary evaporator. The remaining solid material was re-dissolved in 8 mL of acetonitrile:H

The ethanol solution of the acid was added to the solution of Compound A and the vial was rinsed with 1 mL ethanol, which was then added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred for a few minutes, and then the ethanol was evaporated until an oil was formed. Ethyl acetate (3 mL) was added and the solvent was evaporated again to dryness. An amorphous solid was formed.</p>

          <sup>13</sup>C and selective NOE) and 2D (gCOSY, gHSQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were used. All data were in good agreement with the theoretical structure of the salt, shown below. The molecule exists in two conformations in methanol. Based on the integral of the peak assigned to H12 (dominant conformer) and peak assigned to H12' (other conformer), the ratio between the two conformers was found to be 70:30. H22 could not be observed as these protons were in fast exchange with the solvent CD

        <p id="p0200" num="0200">The following generic method was employed to prepare salts of Compound B: 200 mg of compound B (see Preparation B above) was dissolved in 5 mL of MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone). To this solution was added a solution of the relevant acid (1.0 or 0.5 molar equivalent, as indicated in Table 10) dissolved in 1.0 mL of MIBK. After stirring for 10 minutes at room temperature, the solvent was removed by way of a rotary evaporator. The remaining solid material was re-dissolved in about 8 mL of acetonitrile:H
          <sub>2</sub>0 (1:1). Freeze-drying afforded colorless amorphous material in each case.

          <sup>1</sup>H, 
          <sup>13</sup>C and selective NOE) and 2D (gCOSY, gHSQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments was used.
          <br/> All data are in good agreement with the proposed structure, shown below. All carbons and the protons attached to carbons are assigned. Protons attached to heteroatoms are exchanged for deuterium from the solvent and are not detected. Most resonances in the 1D 
          <sup>1</sup>H and 
          <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra are present as sets of two peaks. The reason for this is a slow rotation around the C9-N10 bond, which results in two atropisomers that simultaneously exist in the solution. The 1D NOE experiment is an evidence for this. When a resonance of one atropisomer is irradiated, the saturation is transferred to the corresponding peak of the other atropisomer. The resonances corresponding to the 1,5-naphtalenedisulfonate counter ion do not show atropisomerism.
