  <description id="desc" lang="en">
    <p id="p0001" num="0001">One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a naphthoxazine benzoxazine-based monomer, a polymer thereof, an electrode for a fuel cell including the polymer, an electrolyte membrane for a fuel cell including the polymer, and a fuel cell using the electrode.</p>
    <p id="p0002" num="0002">Fuel cells, which use a polymer electrolyte membrane as an electrolyte, operate at a relatively low temperature and can also be small in size, and thus they are expected to be used as light sources in electric vehicles or distributed generation systems for homes. As a polymer electrolyte membrane used in polymer electrolyte fuel cells, a perfluorocarbonsulfonic acid-based polymer membrane available from Nafion (registered trademark) is used.</p>
    <p id="p0003" num="0003">However, such polymer electrolyte membranes need water for exhibiting proton conduction abilities, and thus the polymer electrolyte membranes need humidifying. In addition, to enhance cell system efficiencies, it is necessary to operate polymer electrolyte membranes at a high temperature of at least 100Â°C. However, the moisture in polymer electrolyte membranes is evaporated at this temperature, and polymer electrolyte membranes can not function as a solid electrolyte.</p>
    <p id="p0004" num="0004">To address those problems in the art, non-humidified electrolyte membranes which can operate at a high temperature of at least 100Â°C under nonhumidified conditions have been developed. For example, 
      <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5525436A">
        <text>US Patent No. 5,525,436</text>
      </patcit> discloses polybenzimidazole doped with a phosphoric acid, and the like as a material constituting non-humidified electrolyte membranes.
      <!-- EPO <DP n="2"> -->
    </p>
    <p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, in cells which operate at a low temperature, such as the cells using a perfluorocarbonsulfonic acid-based polymer membrane, to prevent gas diffusion in electrodes due to water (formation water) that is produced as electricity is generated in an electrode, particularly a cathode, electrodes using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a waterproof agent to have hydrophobic properties have been widely used (For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 
      <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPHEI05283082B">
        <text>hei 05-283082</text>
      </patcit>).
    </p>
    <p id="p0006" num="0006">In addition, phosphoric acid type fuel cells operating at a high temperature of 150 to 200Â°C use a liquid phosphoric acid as an electrolyte. However, a large amount of the liquid phosphoric acid exists in electrodes which interferes with gas diffusion. Therefore, an electrode catalyst layer which is formed by adding polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a waterproof agent to an electrode catalyst, and which can prevent fine pores in electrodes from being clogged by a phosphoric acid, has been used.</p>
    <p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition, in fuel cells using a polybenzimidazole (PBI) electrolyte membrane which retains a phosphoric acid as a nonhumidified electrolyte at a high temperature, to reduce contact between electrodes and the electrolyte membrane, a method of impregnating electrodes with a liquid phosphoric acid has been tried and a method of increasing a loading amount of metal catalysts has been tried. However, the fuel cells do not exhibit improved properties, and thus there is a need for improvement.</p>
    <p id="p0008" num="0008">In addition, in the case of supplying air to a cathode when a solid polymer electrolyte doped with phosphoric acid is used, the fuel cell requires an aging time of about 1 week even if the composition of the cathode is optimized. By supplying oxygen to the cathode instead of air, performance of the cathode can be improved and aging time can also be reduced. However, the supply of oxygen to the cathode is an obstacle in realizing widespread use of the cathode.

    <p id="p0069" num="0069">As a first method, the naphthoxazine benzoxazine-based monomer represented by Formula 1 is blended with a crosslinkable compound, and the mixture is cured at a temperature in the range of 50 to 250Â°C, and preferably 80 to 220Â°C. The cured mixture is impregnated with a proton conductor such as an acid to prepare an electrolyte membrane.</p>
    <p id="p0070" num="0070">The cross-linkable compounds may be at least one selected from polybenzimidazoles (PBI), polybenzimidazole-base complexes, polybenzthiazoles, polybenzoxazoles, and polyimides. The polybenzimidazole-base complexes are disclosed in Korean Patent No.

    <p id="p0071" num="0071">The amount of the crosslinkable compound may be in the range of 5 to 95 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the naphthoxazine benzoxazine-based monomer of Formula 1.</p>
    <p id="p0072" num="0072">When the amount of the crosslinkable compound is less than 5 parts by weight, phosphoric acid cannot be sufficiently impregnated. On the other hand, when the amount of the crosslinkable compound is greater than 95 parts by weight, the

    <p id="p0073" num="0073">As a second method, an electrolyte membrane is formed using a mixture of the naphthoxazine benzoxazine-based monomer represented by Formula 1 and a crosslinkable compound.</p>
    <p id="p0074" num="0074">The formation of the electrolyte membrane may be performed by a tape casting method, or a conventional coating method. The conventional coating method may be a method in which the mixture is cast on a support using a doctor blade. Herein, a doctor blade with a 250 to 500Âµm gap is used.</p>
    <p id="p0075" num="0075">When the casting method using a doctor blade is used, the process of forming the electrolyte membrane further includes separating the electrolyte membrane from the support, between the time when curing of the mixture occurs and the time when impregnation of the resultant with acid occurs. When it is time to perform the process of separating the electrolyte membrane from the support, the mixture is immersed in distilled water with a temperature in the range of 60 to 80Â°C.</p>
    <p id="p0076" num="0076">The support can be any support which can support an electrolyte membrane, for example, a glass substrate, a polyimide film, and the like. When the tape casting method is used, a tape cast membrane is separated from a support such as polyethylenetherephthalate before being cured, and then put into an oven.</p>
    <p id="p0077" num="0077">In addition, when a membrane is formed by the tape casting method using a mixture of a benzoxazine-based monomer and polybenzimidazole, a process of filtering the mixture may be further performed.</p>
    <p id="p0078" num="0078">The tape cast membrane is cured by heat treatment, and then is impregnated with a proton conductor such as acid to form an electrolyte membrane.</p>
    <p id="p0079" num="0079">Non-restrictive examples of the proton conductor include a phosphoric acid, and a C

      <sub>20</sub> organic phosphonic acid. The C

    <p id="p0080" num="0080">The amount of the proton conductor is in the range of 300 to 1,000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the electrolyte membrane. The concentration of the acid used is not particularly limited.

    <p id="p0081" num="0081">A method of preparing a fuel cell using the electrode for a fuel cell according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described.</p>
    <p id="p0082" num="0082">Any electrolyte membrane that is commonly used in the preparation of fuel cells can be used herein. Alternatively, an electrolyte membrane including a crosslinked product of polybenzoxazine-based compounds that is prepared by polymerization of the naphthoxazine benzoxazine-based monomer represented by Formula 1 and a crosslinkable compound can also be used.</p>
    <p id="p0083" num="0083">In particular, performance of the fuel cell may be maximized by using the electrolyte membrane including the polymer of polybenzoxazine-based compounds.</p>
    <p id="p0084" num="0084">For example, the electrolyte membrane that is commonly used in a fuel cell may be a polybenzimidazole electrolyte membrane, a polybenzoxazine-polybenzimidazole copolymer electrolyte membrane, a PTFE porous membrane, or the like.</p>
    <p id="p0085" num="0085">A method of preparing a membrane-electrode assembly for a fuel cell, according to the present invention, is as follows. The term "membrane and electrode assembly (MEA)" used herein refers to a structure in which an electrode, comprising a catalyst layer and a diffusion layer, is deposited on both surfaces of the electrolyte membrane.</p>
    <p id="p0086" num="0086">The MEA may be formed by positioning the electrode including the catalyst layer for an electrode described above at both sides of the electrolyte membrane, joining them all together at a high temperature and a high pressure, and then joining a fuel diffusion layer to the catalyst layers.
      <!-- EPO <DP n="21"> -->
    </p>
    <p id="p0087" num="0087">Herein, the joining is performed under a pressure in the range of 0.1 to 3 ton/cm
      <sup>2</sup>, and particularly about 1 ton/cm
      <sup>2</sup>, in a state reached when the MEA is heated up to a temperature that softens the electrolyte membrane.
    </p>
    <p id="p0088" num="0088">Next, a bipolar plate is disposed on each side of the membrane-electrode assembly to prepare a fuel cell. The bipolar plate has grooves used for supplying fuel, and functions as a current collector.</p>
    <p id="p0089" num="0089">The use of the fuel cell of the present invention is not particularly limited. However, the fuel cell may be preferably used as a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell.</p>
