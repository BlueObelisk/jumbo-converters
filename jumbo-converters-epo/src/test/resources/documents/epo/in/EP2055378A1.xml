Furthermore, the present invention provides a process for preparing a carbonyl compound comprising oxidizing an alcohol by the oxidizing process described above.</p>
<heading id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">In the process for preparing a ruthenium-carrying alumina according to the present invention, trivalent ruthenium (ruthenium(III)) is utilized as a ruthenium source, and alumina is suspended in a solution containing trivalent ruthenium.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Examples of ruthenium compounds which can be used as<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sources of trivalent ruthenium include ruthenium halides such as ruthenium(III) chloride, ruthenium(III) bromide, etc.; oxo acid salts such as ruthenium(III) nitrate, ruthenium(III) sulfate, etc.; and so on. They may be used as a mixture of two or more of them, if desired. Among them, ruthenium halides such as ruthenium(III) chloride are preferable.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Water is usually used as a solvent of the ruthenium solution, although a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, or an organic solvent alone may be used, if necessary. The amount of the solvent is adjusted such that a ruthenium concentration in the solution is usually from 0.1 mM to 1 M, preferably from 1 mM to 100 mM.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The kind of alumina to be suspended in the ruthenium solution is not limited, and various kinds of alumina such as α-alumina, β-alumina, γ-alumina, etc. may be used. Among them, γ<b>-</b>alumina is preferably used. The amount of alumina is adjusted such that an ruthenium content in the ruthenium-carrying alumina is usually from 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">Then, a base is added to the suspension of alumina prepared in the previous step to adjust the pH of the suspension to usually at least 8, preferably at least 10, more preferably 12 to 14. If no base is added, the activity of the ruthenium-carrying alumina as a catalyst for oxidizing alcohols is not sufficiently high.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Examples of the base include metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, etc.; metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, etc.; metal acetates such<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, etc.; ammonia; and the like. They may be used as a mixture of two or more of them, if desired.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">After the addition of the base, the suspension is subjected to solid-liquid separation treatment. Thereby, the ruthenium-carrying alumina is recovered from the suspension. The solid-liquid separation treatment is usually filtration or decantation. The recovered ruthenium-carrying alumina may optionally be post-treated such as washing with water, drying, etc.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The ruthenium-carrying alumina prepared by the above process is preferably used as a catalyst for oxidizing an alcohol with molecular oxygen. This oxidation reaction may be carried out either in a liquid phase or in a gas phase. Preferably, it is carried out in the liquid phase.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The amount of the ruthenium-carrying alumina used in the oxidizing process is usually from 0.000001 to 1 mole, preferably from 0.0001 to 0.1 mole, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.05 mole, in terms of ruthenium per one mole of the alcohol.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The alcohol as a substrate to be oxidized may be a primary alcohol or a secondary alcohol, and may be a monohydric alcohol or a polyhydric alcohol. The alcohol may be used as a mixture of two or more of alcohols, if desired.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, the alcohol as a substrate is an alcohol represented by the following formula (1), (2) or (3):
