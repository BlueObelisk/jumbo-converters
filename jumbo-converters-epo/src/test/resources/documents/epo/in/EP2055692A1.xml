<p id="pa01" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for producing a 2-fluoro-6-halophenol as an intermediate; a process for producing a 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenol and further a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene from the 2-fluoro-6-halophenol; a second process for producing a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene from the 2-fluoro-6-halophenol; and a 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenol. The 2-fluoro-6-halophenol can be obtained using a 2-fluorophenol as a starting material and through a sulfonation reaction, a halogenation reaction, and a deprotection reaction. The 2-fluoro-6-halophenol is alkyl-etherified, and subsequently the halogen atom is converted into a hydroxyl group to obtain the 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenol, which is further alkyl-etherified to thereby obtain the 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene. Alternatively, a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene is also obtained by converting the halogen atom of the 2-fluoro-6-halophenol into a hydroxyl group to thereby form 3-fluorocatechol and subsequently alkyl-etherifying two hydroxyl groups thereof.

<heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Dialkoxybenzene-based compounds have widely been utilized as extremely strong electron donors in many fields and, for example, have been used as intermediates for medicament production, materials for electroluminescence displays and monomers for electrolytic polymerization and also used for production of Ziegler-Natta catalysts for orientation of polyolefins. In particular, 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzenes such as 1,2-diethoxy-3-fluorobenzene are known to be useful as intermediates for medicament production (see <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO02085855A"><text>WO 02/085855</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2004078721A"><text>WO 2004/078721</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO2006018955A"><text>WO 2006/018955</text></patcit>) Processes for synthesizing such compounds have been disclosed in Patents <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5968865A"><text>US 5968865</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6124507A"><text>US 6124507</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US6399837B"><text>US 6399837</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO02085855A"><text>WO 02/085855</text></patcit>. However, in the processes described therein, 2-alkoxyphenol-based compounds are used as starting materials and are reacted with alkyl halides under a strong alkaline atmosphere to introduce other alkoxy groups. In such synthetic processes, the costs of the starting materials are high, the process yields are low, a large amount of sodium hydroxide is required, and also excess alkyl halides are generated in a large<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> amount, so that a post-treatment step becomes troublesome. Therefore, the processes are not suitable for industrial production. Furthermore, there is known a process using 3-fluoroanisole as a starting material and through a (2-alkoxy-6-fluorophenyl) borate derivative (see <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP2005314322A"><text>JP-A-2005-314322</text></patcit>).</p>

<heading id="h0006">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the process of the invention, it is easy to obtain starting materials. Moreover, since a halogen atom is introduced into the 6-position after the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 4-position is protected by a sulfonation reaction, a highly pure 2-fluoro-6-halophenol can be obtained without performing complex separation and purification steps as compared with the process of carrying out a direct halogenation reaction without protecting the 4-position. Namely, in the process of carrying out a direct halogenation reaction, there arises a problem that hydrogen atoms at the 4- and 6-positions are replaced with halogen atoms at the same time to form two kinds of isomers (a compound halogenated at the 4-position and a compound halogenated at the 6-position) which are difficult to separate. However, this problem can be avoided in the process of the invention. Furthermore, since all of the sulfonation reaction, the halogenation reaction, and the deprotection reaction are easy to realize, the production costs are remarkably reduced. According to the invention, since two phenolic hydroxyl groups can be separately alkylated in the production of the 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene, even in the case of producing a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene having different alkoxy groups at the 1- and 2-positions, it can be easily obtained. The production process of the invention has many steps, but the steps are each easy to realize and the process does not require any difficult reaction conditions and the process yields are high, so that the process is extremely suitable for industrial production.</p>

As the solvent, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are preferred and ethanol is particularly preferred.<br/>
The alkyl-etherification reaction is preferably carried out by reacting a 2-fluoro-6-halophenol [D] with an alkylating reagent under a reflux temperature of the solvent for 1 to 10 hours, preferably 2 to 5 hours. In particular, as mentioned above, they are preferably reacted in a solvent in an alkaline atmosphere under a reflux temperature of the solvent for 1 to 10 hours.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Step (5): a step of converting the halogen atom of the 1-alkoxy-2-fluoro-6-halobenzene [E] into a hydroxyl group by a hydrolysis reaction or Grignard reaction to obtain a 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenol [F].<br/>
By a hydrolysis method or a method using a Grignard reagent, the halogen atom of the 1-alkoxy-2-fluoro-6-halobenzene [E] is converted into a hydroxyl group by a hydrolysis reaction or a Grignard reaction. In the reaction, a known method frequently used for converting a halogen atom on an aromatic ring into a phenolic hydroxyl group can be employed. For example, the compound [E] is reacted with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide to effect hydrolysis, whereby the halogen atom can be converted into a hydroxyl group. Moreover, the compound [E] is reacted with magnesium to form a Grignard reagent, and the Grignard reagent is reacted with an oxidizing agent such as an alkyl perbenzoate, alkyl hydroperoxide or oxygen, thereby finally attaining conversion to a hydroxyl group. For example, the Grignard reagent is reacted with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form an<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> aldehyde group, which may be then reacted with hydrogen peroxide to convert the aldehyde group into a hydroxyl group. Moreover, the Grignard reagent is reacted with an alkyl perbenzoate to form an alkoxy group and then the alkoxy group can be converted into a hydroxyl group. The alkyl group (hereinafter referred to as R<sup>3</sup>) in the alkyl perbenzoate is usually limited to specific groups (tert-butyl group etc.) owing to the reactivity and hence is not coincident with the objective R<sup>2</sup> mentioned below in many cases. Therefore, the alkoxy group (-OR<sup>3</sup>) obtained by the reaction with the alkyl perbenzoate is then preferably converted into a hydroxyl group. Moreover, in the conversion of the alkoxy group into the hydroxyl group, there arises the necessity of selecting the alkyl group (R<sup>3</sup>) so that the alkoxy group (-OR<sup>1</sup>) of the compound [E] is not affected. In the case where R<sup>1</sup> of the alkoxy group (-OR<sup>1</sup>) of the compound [E] is a primary alkyl group, the alkyl group (R<sup>3</sup>) is preferably a tertiary alkyl group. For the conversion of the alkoxy group (-OR<sup>3</sup>) into the hydroxyl group, a brφnsted acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid, or a Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride, boron tribromide, a boron trifluoride-diethyl ether complex is employed.<br/>
The reaction of the step (5) is preferably carried out by a method of using a Grignard reagent and, particularly, it is preferred that the halogen atom is converted into a tert-butoxy group by reacting the Grignard reagent with tert-butyl perbenzoate and then the tert-butoxy group is converted into a hydroxyl group. In the case where the halogen atom is an iodine atom, a hydrolysis method can be adopted but in the case where the halogen atom is a bromine atom, there arises a concern that the fluorine atom is also hydrolyzed at the time of hydrolysis. In consideration of the economical efficiency of the whole process of the invention, the halogen atom is preferably a bromine atom, and hence the reaction of the step (5) is preferably carried out by the method of using the Grignard reagent.</p><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> -->
<p id="p0026" num="0026"> By performing the foregoing steps (1) to (5) successively, a 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenol [F] is obtained from 2-fluorophenol [A]. Furthermore, a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene [G] is obtained by performing the following step (6).</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">Step (6): a step of alkyl-etherifying the hydroxyl group of the 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenol [F] with an alkylating reagent to obtain a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene [G].<br/>
The reaction of the step (6) can be carried out by the method substantially the same as the alkyl-etherification in the above-mentioned step (4). Using an alkylating reagent having an alkyl group R<sup>2</sup> as the alkylating reagent, the hydroxyl group of the compound [F] can be converted into an alkoxy group (-OR<sup>2</sup>). In this connection, although it is usually difficult to assign different alkyl groups to R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> by the alternative method of producing the 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene [G] described below, this method which is through the step (6) can easily assign different alkyl groups to R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup>.<br/>
The 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene [G] can be also produced from the 2-fluoro-6-halophenol [D] obtained by performing the foregoing steps (1) to (3) successively, by further performing the following steps (7) and (8) successively.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">Step (7): a step of converting the halogen atom of the 2-fluoro-6-halophenol [D] into a hydroxyl group by a hydrolysis reaction or Grignard reaction to obtain a 3-fluorocatechol [H].<br/>
The reaction of the step (7) can be carried out in the same manner as in the above-mentioned step (5). However, since it is usually difficult to carry out the reaction of the step (7) by the method using a Grignard reagent, it is preferred to carry out the reaction by a hydrolysis method. The reason why it is difficult to carry out a Grignard reaction is that since the compound [D] has a hydroxyl group, a<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> magnesium salt is apt to form when magnesium is reacted with the compound [D], and thus it becomes difficult to obtain a Grignard reagent. Moreover, since there is a concern that hydrolysis of a fluorine atom may occur in the hydrolysis method as mentioned above, the halogen atom of the 2-fluoro-6-halophenol [D] is preferably an iodine atom in the case of this method which is through the step (7).</p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">Step (8): a step of alkyl-etherifying the two hydroxyl groups of 3-fluorocatechol [H] with an alkylating reagent to obtain a 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzene [G].<br/>
The reaction of the step (8) can be carried out by the method substantially the same as the alkyl-etherification in the above-mentioned step (4). Using an alkylating reagent, the two hydroxyl groups of the compound [H] can be converted into respective alkoxy groups (-OR<sup>1</sup> and -OR<sup>2</sup>). In this case, R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> in the compound [G] usually are the same alkyl group.</p>
