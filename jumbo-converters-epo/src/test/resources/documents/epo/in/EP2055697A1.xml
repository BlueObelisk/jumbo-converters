<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention was made in part with government support under grant number #NO1-CO-12400 awarded by the National Cancer Institute and all joint inventors have assigned their rights to Johns Hopkins University. The government may have certain rights in the invention.</p>

<p id="p0002" num="0002">Benzoylphenylurea (BPU) sulfur analogues potency in treating various cancer types.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">The present invention relates to design and synthesis of novel benzoylphenylurea (BPU) and benzoylphenylthiourea (BPTU) oxygen, sulfur, sulfoxide and sulfonyl analogs with increased potency and enhanced water solubility. More specifically, the present invention is directed toward the synthesis of sulfur, hydroximic acid, and boronic acid analogs of BPU.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The lack of selectivity of many cancer agents and the occurrence of intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumors to chemotherapy has been major obstacles in the treatment of cancer. Microtubules, which are key components of the cell, play an important role in a variety of cellular process, including mitosis and cell division. Antimitotic agents are divided into two major classes: (1) microtubule stabilizers such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, which prevent the depolymerization of tubulin.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Although some of these agents have been used as antiproliferative agents in the treatment of human malignancies, they suffer from drug resistance mediated through the expression of efflux pumps.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Benzoylphenylurea (BPU) compounds were originally developed as insecticides, and their antitumor activity was found during random screening. Various analogues of BPU were synthesized, and their cytotoxic activity was examined to establish structure-activity relationships (<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Okada, H., et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 39:2308-2315 (1991</text></nplcit>)). To improve physicochemical properties, organic and water soluble BPU derivatives were developed. See, <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Okada, H., et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 42:57-61 (1994</text></nplcit>); and <nplcit id="ncit0003" npl-type="s"><text>Okada, H., et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull, 47:430-433 (1999</text></nplcit>). Six of these analogues were screened at<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the NCI for their cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. They exhibited potent antitumor activity in vitro against several cancer cell lines, as well in vivo against several tumor models, These compounds also have been reported to be effective inhibitors of tubulin polymerization (<nplcit id="ncit0004" npl-type="s"><text>Holligshead, M. G., et al., Proc. Am. Assoc, Cancer Res., 39:164 (1979</text></nplcit>)). One of these agents, compound 1 (NSC-639829), (<nplcit id="ncit0005" npl-type="s"><text>Holligshead, M. G., et al., Proc. Am.Assoc. Cancer Res., 39:164 (1979</text></nplcit>)) is currently being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials in patients with refractory metastatic cancer. See, <nplcit id="ncit0006" npl-type="s"><text>Messersmith, W. A., et al., Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol., 22:203 (2003</text></nplcit>); and <nplcit id="ncit0007" npl-type="s"><text>Edelman, M. J., et al., Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol., 22:137 (2003</text></nplcit>). It was previously reported the synthesis and antitumor evaluation of a set of BPU analogues (<nplcit id="ncit0008" npl-type="s"><text>Gurulingappa, H., et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 14:2213-2216 (2004</text></nplcit>)).</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">There is still a need to improve physicochemical properties, organic and water soluble BPU derivatives. To that end the present invention discloses a novel series of synthesized derivatives of BPU by replacing the urea moiety with thiourea and the ether linkage with sulfide, sulfoxide, or sulfone groups. The activity of such novel agents, are significantly more toxic to cancer cells in culture.</p>

<p id="p0134" num="0134">Six-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan) were used. The research protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee, and animals were maintained in accordance to guidelines of the American Association of Laboratory Animal Care. Surgical non-diagnostic specimens from patients who had undergone surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were implanted s.c. in one to two mice for each patient, with two small pieces per mouse (F1 generation). Tumors were grown to 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup> and then harvested, divided into small ∼3 x 3 x 3 mm pieces, and transplanted to another five mice, with two tumors per mouse (F2 generation). After a<!-- EPO <DP n="50"> --> second growth passage, tumors were excised and propagated to cohorts of ≥20 mice. These groups constituted the F3, or treatment cohort. Tumors from this third mouse-to-mouse passage were allowed to grow to ∼200 mm3, at which time mice were randomized into three treatment groups, with five to six mice (10 evaluable tumors) in each group: control (vehicle), 6n (50 mg/kg i.p. twice per week), and 7d (50 mg/kg i.p. twice per week). Docetaxel treatment was given to selected groups at a dose of 30 mg/kg i.p. once a week for 2 weeks. Mice were monitored daily for signs oftoxicity and were weighed thrice per week. Tumor size was evaluated twice per week by caliper measurements using the following formula: tumor volume = [length x width<sup>2</sup>] / 2. Relative tumor growth inhibition was calculated by relative tumor growth of treated mice divided by relative tumor growth of control mice from the onset of therapy (T/C).</p>

<heading id="h0015"><b><u style="single">Statistical Analysis</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0138" num="0138">To assess the treatment effect, a hierarchical linear regression model was used with random intercepts and fixed slopes. Based on the results of exploratory plots, the assumption of fixed effects for slopes seemed reasonable. This model allowed for mouse effects to be nested within patient effects so that the hierarchical structure is fully accounted for. Specifically, the following linear regression model was fitted: log (<i>y<sub>iJt</sub></i>) = a<sub>1<i>ij</i></sub>time<i><sub>ijt</sub></i> + b<sub>2<i>j</i></sub>time<i><sub>ijt</sub></i> x trt<i><sub>ij</sub></i> + βtime<sup>2</sup><i><sub>ijt</sub></i> + e<i><sub>ijt</sub></i> where <i>j</i> indexes patient, <i>i</i> indexes mouse,<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> and t indexes time; y<i><sub>ijt</sub></i> is the percentage change in tumor volume (compared with day 0) in mouse <i>i</i>, which is a xenograft for patient <i>j</i> at time <i>t</i>; and trt<i><sub>ij</sub></i> is treatment (1 = treated, 0 =control) received by mouse <i>i</i>, which is a xenograft for patient <i>j</i>. A series of models to determine a good fitting model were explored and found that the above model was adequate. An intercept and main effect of treatment were not included in the model that makes two assumptions: (a) at time 0, the change from baseline is 0 (which is empirically true), and (b) at baseline, the treated and untreated curves intersect. The model was fit using Win-Bugs software that estimates models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation procedure. A burn-in of 10,000 iterations was done, and then the chain was run for an additional 20,000 iterations, of which every 10<sup>th</sup> iteration was saved for inference. Several chains were run with different starting values to ensure convergence. No convergence issues arose. The fitted model was used to make inferences with respect to the treatment effect and to create fitted regression lines (rescaled on the Y-axis for clearer interpretation). Point estimates of variables of interest (e.g., expected difference in tumor volume between treated and control at 28 days) and 95% credible intervals were based on the mean of posterior distributions and the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the posterior distribution, respectively. The comparisons between means and proportions obtained from the biological studies were done using Student's <i>t</i>-test and χ<sup>2</sup> method, respectively. ANOVA was used when three or more variables were compared.</p>

Cells were trypsinized, seeded at 5x10<sup>3</sup> cells/well in 96-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 hours before the treatment with exponential increasing concentrations of drugs in the presence of 10% FBS. After a 96-hours period of treatment, 20 µl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well, and the plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. Medium was then replaced with 100 µl of DMSO per well. Plates were shaken and the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a multiwell plate reader (Bio-Rad, Model 550, Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). Each experiment was performed in triplicate for each drug concentration and was carried out independently at least 3 times. The IC<sub>50</sub> value was defined as the concentration needed for a 50% reduction in the absorbance calculated based on the survival curves.

<p id="p0159" num="0159">Both compounds 6n and 7ds showed similar effects on the 11 pancreatic cancer cell line panel. Clonogenic growth was impaired at concentrations between 0.01 and 0.5 µmol/L (<figref idref="f0021">Fig. 35B</figref>), with no colony formation at higher doses in 9 of the 11 cell lines. MAPT mRNA levels varied over a wide (65,000-fold) range (<figref idref="f0022">Fig. 35C</figref>). Expression was normalized to the lowest sample, which was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1. There was a correlation between mRNA and protein, with the three lowest mRNA-expressing cells lines showing a low protein expression. Two isoforms of MAPT protein were detected (45 and 65 kDa). The three cell lines with lower MAPT mRNA levels expressed traces of the 65-kDa isoform. The 45-kDa isoform predominates in E3LZ10, ASPC1, Panc203, and Panc1005 (the second highest MAPT-expressing cell line), whereas the 65-kDa isoform predominates in XPA4, E3JD13, and MiaPaCa2 (the highest MAPT-expressing cell line). The two MAPT isoforms seemed equally expressed in L36PL.</p>

In the eight high protein-expressing cell lines, no correlation between isoform expression and activity was detected.

<heading id="h0027"><b><u style="single">In vivo Dose-Finding Study of compounds 6n and 7d</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0167" num="0167">Both compounds were explored by the i.p. route in cohorts of six mice each, with a duration of treatment of 4 weeks. The two initial dose levels of both compounds (20 mg/kg twice per week and 30 mg/kg twice per week) were not associated with noticeable toxicity. Therefore, 50 mg/kg twice per week was explored. One of six mice in the 6n group had a weight loss of 15% by the 4th week, but no deaths occurred. Therefore, the dose was escalated to 54 mg/kg thrice per week. In the 6n and 7d groups, respectively, two and one of the mice died in the 3rd week, and three of four and four of five of the remaining animals loss &gt;15% of their weight. Thus, for 28-day efficacy studies following an i.p. route, we selected 50 mg/kg twice a week for both compounds.</p>
<heading id="h0028"><b><u style="single">In vivo Growth Inhibition Analysis</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0168" num="0168">Tumors from nine cases of pancreatic cancer were used to establish xenografts in nude mice, and the animals were treated with either vehicle, 6n, or 7d (<figref idref="f0023">Fig. 36A</figref>). The level of efficacy varied both between drugs and within cases treated with each drug. <figref idref="f0024">Figure 37</figref> provides an integrated summary of all data points obtained in the studies. Overall, there were no statistical differences between the slopes of the treated versus control group for either of the agents, although 6n showed a greater efficacy than 7d. Assessment of individual groups, as shown in <figref idref="f0023">Fig. 36A</figref>, shows that in 6n-treated tumors, four cases had<!-- EPO <DP n="62"> --> an average growth after 28 days of treatment of ≤50%, and a fifth had 60%. In contrast, 7d induced significant growth arrest in only two cases with growths of 43% and 59%.</p>
<heading id="h0029"><b><u style="single">In vivo Correlation between MAPT and Efficacy</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0169" num="0169">To gain insight into factors that could at least partially explain the observed observations, we determined the expression of MAPT in the patient tumor xenografts. Expression was normalized to the lowest sample, which was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1. There was a correlation between mRNA and protein, with the three highest mRNA-expressing cases showing significant protein expression by Western blot. The five cases with the lowest MAPT expression were those where 6n showed a tumor growth reduction that was statistically significant compared with their respective control groups; or, inversely, in all cases with low MAPT levels, 6n was able to significantly inhibit tumor growth. However, one of those, despite being significant, was not considered relevant, as the T/C was 60%. The comparison of the proportion of sensitive cases according to having below (4 of 5) or above (0 of 4) the median MAPT expression is statistically significant (two-sided Fisher's test, P = 0.048). 7d induced growth arrest in two cases with minimal expression of MAPT, but this trend is weaker than with 6n, as fewer cases were sensitive. Consequently, the predictive value for 7d is lower.</p>
<heading id="h0030"><b><u style="single">Comparison of 6n and 7d In vivo Activity with Docetaxel</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0170" num="0170">Three of the cases were also treated with docetaxel to compare the efficacy of the benzoylphenylurea agents with an established anticancer agent targeting microtubules and also to determine the correlation of such efficacy and MAPT expression (<figref idref="f0023">Fig. 36B</figref>). Docetaxel, as was the case with both 6n and 7d, was particularly efficacious in 215, a low MAPT-expressing case. Docetaxel showed lower efficacy than 6n in 185, and all three compounds were inactive in 194, a case with the greatest expression of MAPT among those examined.</p>
<heading id="h0031"><b><u style="single">Analysis of Class III β-Tubulin Expression and MAPT and Class I β-Tubulin Mutations</u></b></heading>
<p id="p0171" num="0171">The level of expression of class III β -tubulin was also assessed in the cell lines and in the tumors. Although among the lowest expressing cell lines for class III β -tubulin were HS766T and Panc1, and the highest was MiaPaCa2, the correlation for the group of cell lines as a whole was poor (<figref idref="f0022">Fig. 35E</figref>), and there was not a correlation between class III β -tubulin and efficacy. In addition, there was neither a correlation between MAPT and class III β -tubulin in the xenografts nor a relationship with efficacy (the highest expression of class III β -tubulin corresponded to A6E and 286, and resistant<!-- EPO <DP n="63"> --> cases had low or intermediate expression such as 194 or 253; data not shown). No mutations or polymorphisms in exons 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of MAPT or in exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 of class I β tubulin were found in the tested panel of cell lines (n = 11) and patient xenograft cases used in the in vivo studies (n = 9).</p>
<p id="p0172" num="0172">From Tables 2 and 3, it is interesting to note that the NO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub> substituents at position 2 of the benzoyl moiety and the Br substituent at position 4 on the pyrimidinyl ring apparently play an important role in the activity of these compounds. Compounds lacking either or both groups displayed weak activity. These findings were in accordance with previously reported structure-activity relationships. See, <nplcit id="ncit0037" npl-type="s"><text>Okada, H., et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 39:2308-2315 (1991</text></nplcit>); and <nplcit id="ncit0038" npl-type="s"><text>Gurulingappa, H., et al.. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 14:2213-2216 (2004</text></nplcit>). In addition, replacement of the urea moiety with thiourea (6g and 6h) had little effect on the activity. Introduction of a sulfide bridge between phenyl and pyrimidinyl rings resulted in higher activity than did an ether link. This variation was observed for compounds 6n and 7d (Tables 2 and 3), both of which showed a significant anticancer effect. For example, an increase in potency of 111-fold for Panc430, 8-fold for Panc1 and Mia- paca2, 14-fold for Panc203, 100-fold for CWR22R, and 20- fold for the LnCap cell line was obtained for compound 6n over 6m. Similarly, when compared to 7c, the activity of 7d was increased by &gt;117-fold for Panc203, 9-fold for Miapaca2, &gt;50-fold for Panc430, 39-fold for Panc1, and 7-fold for the LAPC-4 cell line. A large decrease in the activity of 8g and 8h (when compared to that of 6n) was also seen with the modification of sulfide to sulfoxide and sulfone. Even though 6m and 6n were effective in inhibiting tubulin assembly, their poor binding affinity for colchicine binding site indicates the existence of an alternate binding site mechanism.</p>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">The best administration schedule for compounds 6n and 7d was determined and tested in a novel platform of direct pancreas cancer xenografts taken from patient tumors. These studies showed that compounds 6n and 7d are the best candidates for further development. In addition, it was found that MAPT expression in pancreas tumor cells and tissue is a marker that thus far predicts the efficacy of compound 6n. The patient-derived xenograft model is feasible, with a high engraftment rate. Even more importantly for new drug development, the patient-derived xenografts are stable over time and passages, both genetically and from the perspective of drug sensitivity. The ability to test several drugs simultaneously allows for direct comparisons, and the availability of large amounts of tissue permits the<!-- EPO <DP n="64"> --> performance of detailed biological analyses as well as the development of novel techniques for seriated pharmacodynamic assessment.</p>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">Both compounds 6n and 7d had antiproliferative activity in vitro in the low nanomolar range and showed a similar mechanism of action, with the former twice as potent as the latter as an inhibitor of tubulin assembly. This probably accounts for the greater in vivo activity of 6n. This is consistent with the finding that increased levels of MAPT were associated with resistance to these benzoylphenylurea analogues because MAP, including MAPT, strongly enhance tubulin assembly.</p>
<p id="p0175" num="0175">Another finding was that in a direct comparison in three of the cases, 6n was at least as efficacious (if not better) than docetaxel, an active anticancer agent with some activity in pancreas cancer. In comparison with other agents tested in the same patient-derived xenografts, 6n was superior to erlotinib. Additionally, the potential value of MAPT, a protein that binds to microtubule and enhances their assembly and stability and that has been linked to sensitivity to paclitaxel and docetaxel was explored. In both the cell lines and the patient-derived xenografts, there was an exquisite correlation between mRNA and protein levels, which increases the likelihood of developing a feasible diagnostic test for clinical use. Equally important, there was also a solid, inverse correlation between MAPT expression and sensitivity to all tested agents. Specifically, the same inverse correlation between MAPT and 6n/7d activity occurred with docetaxel (both in prior clinical data and in the preclinical experiments), despite the opposing mechanisms of action of benzoylphenylureas and taxanes (inhibition of tubulin assembly versus enhancement of assembly, respectively). As was noted above, the inverse correlation of MAPT expression with drug sensitivity is readily understood with the benzoylphenylurea analogues because MAP in general strongly enhance microtubule formation and thus may reduce the effect of drugs that interfere with microtubule formation.</p>
<p id="p0176" num="0176">In conclusion, the sulfur analogues of BPU of the present invention had excellent growth inhibition activity against both pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines. Compounds 6n and 7d were both found to be more potent than compound 1. Moreover, the results obtained, specifically show that compounds 6n and 7d are the most potent in terms of cytotoxicity, growth inhibition, IC<sub>50</sub>, and inhibition oftubulin polymerization, and colchicine binding in prostate cancer cell lines and pancreatic cancer cell lines.</p>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">NO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub> substituents at position 2 (as found in compounds 6m and compounds 7C, respectively) on the A ring (rings A-C in the BPUs, from left to right, respectively) and the Br<!-- EPO <DP n="65"> --> substituent at position 4 on the C ring apparently play an important role in the activity of these compounds. BPUs lacking either or both groups exhibited weak activity. The experiments as described herein do not include an O-bridge compound possessing NO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub> substituents at position 2 on A ring and Br substituent at position 4 on C ring.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">The data presented herein also supports structure-activity relation-("SAR") of compounds 6d, 6h, 6n, 7b, 7d, 8g, and 8h in terms of critical groups which confer activity. Specifically, NO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub> substituents at position 2 (as found in compounds 6n, 8g and 8h and compounds 7b and d, respectively) on the A ring and the Br substituent at position 4 on the C ring (as found in compounds 6n, 7d, 8g, and 8h) apparently play an important role in the activity of these BPUs as suggested by the results of inhibition of tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding assay.<!-- EPO <DP n="66"> -->
